This mini project is centered on letting you see few states where you can retire your awesome self after a lot of tiring years working.

## Data Visualization
There are a lot of ways this visualization can be done, but since it's ust a mini project, I just did a simple dashboard with like three(3) factors namely, weather, overall rate and culture rating. If you plan on going to a state for retirement, and they have a culture that doesn't favor outsiders then there are chances you won't enjoy your stay at the state, so it's also important you consider their culture ranking and the type of culture they observe.

## Findings
At the end of the analysis and all, it was observed and established that under the factor of weather ranking, "Maine state" is the best state for retirement because they have the most favorable weather with not too cold and not too hot weather all round a year, that's awesome for anybody. When it comes to culture ranking, Texas city take the lead, as they are very popular and highly populated due to their favorable and awesome culture ranking from their ranching and cowboy culture, their official sport, Rodeo which is accepted and engaged by the whole of America, this and lots more make Texas the best state to visit based on culture ranking, and lastly the overall ranking. The overall ranking was deduced by comparing differents factors together, after all the comparing and contrasting, the overall state for retirement is Maryland
